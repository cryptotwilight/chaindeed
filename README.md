# On Chain Deeds 
Welcome to the On Chain Deed repository. The On Chain Deed project is being built to provide users with a new more convinient way of doing DeFi. In short user assets by nature are scattered on blockchain, a user can have a mix of NFTs and tokens that are not readily 
utilisable in DeFi. The on Chain Deed project provides a way for users to aggregate their assets creating a verified and transferable deed that CAN be used in DeFi. 

To Illustrate a user may have an NFT worth $20, another worth $350 and some cryptocurrency in pots (say 3) of totaling $50 spread across blockchain projects. This gives the user a total of $420 of collateralizable capital. Today it would be a  laborious process to liquidate the NFTs and homogenize the various tokens likely resulting in a realization well below $420. 

By Utilizing an On Chain Deed however the user can codify their NFTs and cryptocurrency assigning them to the Deed. The deed tokenizes the assets storing them away in a verifiable (non custodial) vault and assigning an oracle based value. This deed can be transferred and staked in On Chain Deed Liquidity Pools where the deed holder can borrow against the deed. Should the holder fail to repay the loan by the term the deed is consequently liquidated. Should the value of the deed fall below 10% of it's initial value again the deed will be liquidated. 

This creates a brand new DeFi paradigm that enables users to leverage assets previously rendered "non-functional" due to their low value. 

The On chain Deed project is currently premiering on the Mode Network.
